Tools for sonic-pi (4 tools)                                                                                                                                                   initialize_sonic_pi                                                                                                                                      play_music
stop_music                                                                                                                                               get_beat_pattern   

create a file src/hip.sp and use sonic-pi mcp to initialise sonic-pi then get_beat_pattern something in a hip hop style, put that in the file, then play it 

1. In Sonic Pi: Go to Preferences/Settings and verify that:
    - "Enable OSC server" is checked
    - The port is set to 4557 (default)
  2. Check if Sonic Pi is listening: You could run this to see if port 4557 is open:
  netstat -ln | grep 4557
  3. The MCP server configuration might need the correct host/port settings for your Sonic Pi instance.

        }

nope, it's not supported

4559 port is changed to 4560

hardwired in psonic lib, seem to have version incompatibility with what I got from Ubuntu repo.
